I wanted this site to have an audience of anyone that would be interested in looking at the photos, purchasing photos, or simply finding out more information about the photos and the artist. I think that one challenge I could have in reaching this audience is lack of exposure and competition with similar content. The artist is not well known and it is only a hobby for him, so there are so many more popular photographers out there. I tried to make the website easy to use and appealing to the eye, with the photographs themselves as the main focus, and what pops on the page. In line with this effort, I have about 25 different photographs features throughout the website. I also chose to only use minimal different colors and simple fonts. I would like to get feed back on fuctionality of going from the home page to the different pages, and what can be improved there.
